There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbours.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains N integers in an array A.
Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the minimum candies to be given.
Example:
Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Output 1:
3
def candy(A):
    n = len(A)
    candies = [1] * n

    # Traverse from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > A[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

    # Traverse from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if A[i] > A[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)

    # Sum up the candies
    min_candies = sum(candies)

    return min_candies

# Example usage:
input_array = [1, 2]
output_result = candy(input_array)
print(output_result)  # Output: 3

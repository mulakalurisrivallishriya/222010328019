You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains an integer A, the number of steps.
Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the number of ways to reach the top.
Constrains:
1 <= A <= 36
Example :
Input 1:
A = 2 Output 1:
2 Explanation 1:
[1, 1], [2] Input 2:
A = 3 Output 2:
3 Explanation 2:
[1 1 1], [1 2], [2 1]
code:
def climbStairs(A):
    memo = {}

    def climb(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        ways = climb(n - 1) + climb(n - 2)
        memo[n] = ways
        return ways

    return climb(A)

# Example usage:
print(climbStairs(2))  # Output: 2
print(climbStairs(3))  # Output: 3
